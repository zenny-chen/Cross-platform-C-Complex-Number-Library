<br />

As we all know, C99 introduced complex number library. Although the current MSVC support C17 dialect, **`<complex.h>`** it supplies is quite different from the C99 standard library.

This project intends to make the complex number support consistent with both C11 standard library and MSVC library for the C programming language conformed with C11 standard.

This project is written under Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition with C17 C language dialect. It is also verified on Android Studio NDK environment.
